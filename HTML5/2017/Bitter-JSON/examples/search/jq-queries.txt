jq query Description
--------------------
.cities[0]            Get the first city. jq Array filtering starts at 0.
.cities[-1]           Get the last city. An index of -1 indicates the last element of an Array.
.cities[0:3]          Get the first three cities, where 0 is the start index (inclusive), and 3 is the end
                      index (exclusive).

.cities[:3]           Get the first three cities. This is shorthand, and it omits the start index.

[.cities[:3] | .[] | {name, weather}]
                      Get the name and weather for the first 3 cities and put it in a new array.

.cities[] | select (.main.temp >= 80 and (.main.temp_min >= 79 and .main.temp_max <= 92))
                      Get all cities whose current temperature is >= 80 degrees Fahrenheit and whose
                      min and max temperature ranges between 79 and 92 degrees Fahrenheit
                      (inclusive).
